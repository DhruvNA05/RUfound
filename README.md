RUFound - Lost and Found for rutgers
People lose things on campus all the time and have a tough time finding them because they don’t know who found their belongings or where they ended up.
People post lost/found things on instagram/snapchat and there's no guarantee it will be seen by whomever lost/found the item. Our application would create a singular place where people can search for their items without having to check multiple different apps/places on campus

PURPOSE:
Create a place where students can post items you’ve lost/found in a single place.
AUDIENCE:
Rutgers students
FEATURES:
NetID authentication (login) / rather than inputting email and password, netID suffices as this is something you use only when you lose something, not everyday
Report Lost/Found items - 
View items (list/catalog) - Ability to search/create posts with tags to make it easier to search
User-to-user messenger contact if an item is found 
Photo/description/category of the item lost
MAYBE: Implement a location function as map: the app would have a built in dynamic map which you could mark where items were found/lost and could use that to make your searches
